Constructor:

tinkery_data/tags/functions/blocks/constructor/init <- pre-create output items in storage
tinkery_data/tags/functions/blocks/constructor/craft <- use for custom recipes
tinkery_data/tags/functions/blocks/constructor/craft_post <- vanilla recipes done here

Custom stuff to put on tool:
TinkeryInit:{,
    Type: (String), tool type
    Traits: [(String) Array], add some strings here. Might be handy when testing tools for stuff. (such as "chargeable" to indicate it has power etc...)
    Durability: (integer),
    AttackSpeed: (float), has a -4 offset
    AttackDamage: (float), has a -1 offset
    Armor: (amount * 10),
    Toughness: (amount * 10),
    KnockbackResistance: (amount * 10),
    MaxHealth: (amount * 10),
    Luck: (amount * 10),
    Attributes: [(String) Array], add default attributes ids
    BlockList: [(String) Array], add blocked attributes ids,
    ColorIndex: The start index of the custom model data. See above
    CustomModelData: Will override the ColorIndex,
    PreventLayers: Prevent attribute layers being added
}


Attributes:

tinkery_data/tags/functions/attributes/init <- initialise attributes
tinkery_data/tags/functions/attributes/test <- test when applying materials
tinkery_data/tags/functions/attributes/level_up <- called when an attribute levels up
tinkery_data/tags/functions/attributes/custom_next <- called when calculating custom next operation (see below)


#tinkery_data:attributes/init
Attribute:{
    id: (String),
    name: (String),
    layerIndex: (int), add 2^layerIndex to custom model data
    current: (int), the current progress towards next level,
    level: (int), the current level
    maxLevel: (int), the highest level possible. Default 10
    next: (int), The amount of items needed to reach the next level.
        when current >= next the level is increased by 1, and next is recalculated. Current is not reset to 0
    base: used to calculate next,
    modi: a variable used to help calculate next,
    offset: a static offset for next
    operation: the way next is recalculated. Examples shown 
        0: (level + modi) * base + offset,
            difference between numbers doesn't change
            with base = 16, modi = 1, offset = 0
            0: 16, 1: 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176

        1: (base * level^2) + (modi * level) + offset,
            difference between numbers increases by base
            with base = 8, modi = 24, offset = 16
            0: 16, 1: 48, 96, 160, 240, 336, 448, 576, 720, 880, 1056
                 +32,  +48, +64, +80, +96,+112,+128,+144,+160,+176
           
        2: base * (modi ^ level) + offset,
            difference is multiplied by modi
            with base = 8, modi = 2, offset = 0
            modi = 2, so difference is doubled
            0: 16, 1: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384
                  +16   +32,+64,+128,+256,+512,+1024,+2048,+4096,+8192

        -1: custom,
            this calls the tag #tinkery_data:attributes/custom_next
            make sure to do extra checks, to not blanket calculate for all custom next calculates (such as put a custom nbt tag like: {MyCustomOperation:123})
            You can find the attribute data in:
            storage tinkery:recipes attributes.current
}



Tick:
#tinkery_data:tick/slot/XXXX
Runs every tick when equipped in slots
Item found at `tinkery:core tick.item`
- mainhand
- offhand
- helmet
- chestplate
- leggings
- boots

- any - runs for all the above

- #tinkery:tick/slot/post_XXXX runs after the above, and is mainly to assist if needing to store any values back into item in player's inventory (such as durability)

- Damage is automatically calculated is post tick, so during tick, add or subtract to the item.tag.Damage value as you please
